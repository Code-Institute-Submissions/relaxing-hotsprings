### Testing of each page

#### Home Page:

1. Navigation bar:
    1. On a desktop, go to the Home page.
    2. Using Chrome Developer Tools, check at different screen sizes and that the hamburger icon appears rather than the full menu bar when at a medium size or smaller screen.
    3. Made sure that there wasnt any overflow. Originally the hamburger icon appeared only on small and extra small screens. Changed it to include medium as menu items were stacking improperly.
    4. Test that logo home link is working, added missing title attribute.
    5. Checked each navigation menu item for proper operation.
    6. Verified that the Book Now link was working properly.
    7. Verified that navigation bar was responsive at each screen size.
