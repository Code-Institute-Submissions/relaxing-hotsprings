# Relaxing Hot Springs

View website on [Github Pages](https://freddorn.github.io/relaxing-hotsprings/)

A hot spring resort located on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state, in the United States. It is inside Olympic National Park,
one of the national parks in the US National Park Service. The resort receives many visitors from across the world, who come to enjoy
the soothing mineral waters that the resort offers. Guests can come visit for the day, or stay overnight in one of the cabins.
There are hiking trails in the surrounding area, for those who wish to explore the valley.

 
## UX
 
Guests from across the country and world visit the resort and national park. In designing this website, I wanted to provide an easy
to use site with all the important information of the resort and surrounding valley. Used a color scheme on the header and footer
that uses the colors of the forest.

### User Stories

*As a returning visitor to the resort, I would like to check on lodging availability, make a reservation easily and see what has changed, since my last visit.
*As a potential visitor to the National Park, I appreciate that the website informs day users, that they can come here just for the day, to soak in the pools, or take part in any activity that the resort or surrounding valley offers.
*As a new visitor to the website, I would like an easy to use site, that is simple in design, with information organized in easy to find sections.
*As a potential visitor to the National Park, I enjoy seeing enticing images of the resort and surrounding area, highlighting its beauty, that would make me want to come visit the area.
*As a potential visitor to the resort, I appreciate information of what the resort offers and the dining options avilable.

## Features

The website has 5 pages- Home, Lodging, Dining, Hot Springs and Pool, Contact.

* The header is the same on all 5 pages and is  emerald green. It includes the Relaxing Hot Springs logo, a navbar for all the pages and a Book Now link to Booking.com. The navbar will collapse to a hamburger type menu on screen sizes smaller than medium.
* The footer is the same on all 5 pages and is brown, which compliments the green of the header, creating a forest colors combination. The footer includes the address and directions to the resort as well as Social Media links.
* The Main page features an image carousel of 4 images of the resort, information about the resort and surrounding area and images of the surrounding area.
* The Lodging page features an exterior view of a cabin, an interior view of each room type, as well as information about each room type.
* The Dining page features a view of inside the dining room, an image of the outside patio dining area, a decription of the food served and the hours of operation.
* The Hot Springs and Pool page has images of the pool area, price and hours information, temperature and depth information of each pool.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
