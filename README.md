# Relaxing Hot Springs

View website on [Github Pages](https://freddorn.github.io/relaxing-hotsprings/)

A hot spring resort located on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state, in the United States. It is inside Olympic National Park,
one of the national parks in the US National Park Service. The resort receives many visitors from across the world, who come to enjoy
the soothing mineral waters that the resort offers. Guests can come visit for the day, or stay overnight in one of the cabins.
There are hiking trails in the surrounding area, for those who wish to explore the valley.

 
## UX
 
Guests from across the country and world visit the resort and national park. In designing this website, I wanted to provide an easy
to use site with all the important information of the resort and surrounding valley. Used a color scheme on the header and footer
that uses the colors of the forest.

### User Stories

* As a returning visitor to the resort, I would like to check on lodging availability, make a reservation easily and see what has changed, since my last visit.
* As a potential visitor to the National Park, I appreciate that the website informs day users, that they can come here just for the day, to soak in the pools, or take part in any activity that the resort or surrounding valley offers.
* As a new visitor to the website, I would like an easy to use site, that is simple in design, with information organized in easy to find sections.
* As a potential visitor to the National Park, I enjoy seeing enticing images of the resort and surrounding area, highlighting its beauty, that would make me want to come visit the area.
* As a potential visitor to the resort, I appreciate information of what the resort offers and the dining options available.
